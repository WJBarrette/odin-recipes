        <p> This is an extremely flavorful and healthy recipe that can be made in <br>
            under 20 minutes with an air fryer. Throw in some fries or broccoli <br>
            halfway through the recipe and you have an entire meal.</p>

        <p> Although it looks like an intimidating dish, Chicken Tikka Masala is <br>
            actually quite easy to make as long as you have a spice rack. In this <br>
             dish, there's no such thing as too spicy.</p>

        <p> This is perhaps the most unique dish on the list for an American pallette. <br>
             Sinigang brings a sour dimension to soup with tamarin powder, which you <br>
             can never overdo. This in tangent with its many vegetables and pork ribs <br>
             that melt in your mouth makes this option as healthy as it is delicious.</p>
